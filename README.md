# nubank_challenge

This project aims to solve a proposed challenge for a mobile software engineer position at Nubank.

Clean architecture was used to solve the project, together with functional programming, TDD and good development practices in order to expose to the evaluators my knowledge and the way I use these technologies in my daily life as needed.

**Note: The service provided in the instructions was down from the time the challenge description was sent to the delivery deadline. Therefore, the project was developed offline (mocked), but the development for the remote service was also added, however I could not test the remote implementation due to this unavailability problem. 

To switch between remote and mocked datasources, just change the Environment variable in the main.dart file.
